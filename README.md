Candelario D. Eguia

A former hobby programer working in the Basic language. I have worked on the testing side of both software and construction, and am having a blast coming back to the programing side of industry. I am currently working with a startup whose main goal is getting kids using high tech tools focused around computer software.

I am currently in the final stages of completing my __Bachelor's of Engineering in Computer Software__ at the *University of La Verne*. I enjoy a variety of activities and love delving into new fields. A few of the thing I like to do in my spare time include:

+ Programming
+ PodCast Junkie
    + Linux Action Show
    + Coder Radio
    + Coding BLocks Podcast
    + The Restart Podcast
