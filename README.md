Candelario D. Eguia

A former hobby programer working in the Basic language. I have been working on the testing side of both software and construction, and have had a blast coming back to the programing side of industry. I am currently working with a startup whose main goal is getting kids using high tech tools focused around computer software.

I am currently in the final stages of completing my Bachelor's of Engineering in Computer Software at the University of La Verne. I enjoy a variety of activities and love delving into new fields. A few of the thing I like to do in my spare time include::</p>

+ Programming
+ PodCast Junkie
+ Linux Unplugged
    + Coder Radio
    + Restart
+ Reading
    + Military
    + SiFi
+ Martial Arts
+ Yoga
