## About me

Candelario D. Eguia

A former hobby programer working in the Basic language. I have worked on the testing side of both software and construction, and am having a blast coming back to the programing side of industry. I have worked with the maker-space startup [Be A Maker Club](https://www.beamaker.club/) and am currently developing open source software for [The Eureka Room](https://www.theeurekaroombham.com/) through an association with [TAG NW](https://www.tagnw.org/).

Having acquired a [Bachelor's of Computer Science](https://artsci.laverne.edu/compsci/) with a concentration in __Software__ from the [University of La Verne](http://www.laverne.edu/) I enjoy a variety of activities and love delving into new fields. I currently spend my commute listening to [Jupiter broadcasting](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/) and the [Coding Blocks](https://www.codingblocks.net/) podcasts among others.
